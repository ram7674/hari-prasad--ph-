                                <p class="impact-text">Corporate communication is how companies share information to internal
                                    and external audiences and engage these audiences in a bid to manage
                                    brand perception. Corporate communication is made up of three major
                                    categories, which are management communication, marketing
                                    communication, and company communication.
                                </p>
                                <p class="impact-text">Using corporate communication, the communications department builds the
                                    company image, maintains a positive reputation in the industry, and bridges
                                    information gaps between employees and management. The audiences
                                    targeted through a corporate communication strategy include customers,
                                    prospects, employees, stakeholders, the media, regulatory agencies, and
                                    the general public.
                                </p>
                                <p class="impact-text">Corporate communication helps to maintain company wide contact so that
                                    all departments can work together towards a shared mission. When used
                                    externally, corporate communication helps the company achieve various
                                    purposes, including maintaining its brand identity, directing brand
                                    reputation, managing crises, and clarifying any discrepancies perceived
                                    about the company’s offerings or activities.
                                </p>
                                <p class="impact-text">It typically takes a different form depending on which audience is being
                                    addressed. It often consists of written (website, press releases, memos),
                                    verbal (interviews, videos, press conferences), and visual (photographs,
                                    infographics, illustrations) communication. Building a corporate
                                    communication strategy helps companies drive growth, scale, and stay
                                    competitive, and its success hinges on building a strong brand identity.
                                    To do this, internal and external communication capabilities need to be
                                    aligned. Let’s start by defining each.

                                    within a company. It includes communication from executives to
                                    employees, among teams as well as inter-departmental messages and
                                    company wide communication.

                                <p class="impact-text">Examples of internal communications include newsletters, team meetings,
                                    knowledge management tools, company memos, training sessions,
                                    company brochures, employee handbooks, and more. The human

                                    departments to ensure that information sharing is easy and efficient.

                                    communication has now extended beyond press coverage to social media.
                                    It covers all forms of communication that promote the company’s
                                    messaging.

                                    concerned about messaging disseminated to audiences outside the

                                <p class="impact-text">The primary goal of corporate communications is to ensure that

                                    manner. This goal comes with widespread functions that we will examine
                                    below. It also encompasses other objectives that make corporate
                                    communications pivotal to a company’s success.

                                    internally through team meetings, company materials like employee
                                    handbooks, etc.

                                    and services. Corporate communications functions can collide with
                                    marketing to ensure that advertising channels are correctly utilized to
                                    generate interest in a company’s product. Similarly, corporate communications play an essential role in stakeholder
                                    communication.

                                    to maintain brand reputation by forestalling anticipated damage or repairing
                                    any damage caused already to the company’s public perception.

                                    to the public. It’s the task of corporate communication teams to create
